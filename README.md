# Classification-Model-for-Twitter-Spam-Detection
This project develops a predictive model to identify Twitter spammers using various classification techniques. The Random Forest model achieved an 88.25% accuracy rate, offering valuable insights for enhancing cybersecurity on social media platforms.

Project Details: 
In response to escalating cyber threats and online fraud on social media platforms, this data mining project aims to create a predictive model for identifying Twitter spammers based on user accounts and tweet characteristics. Detecting patterns indicative of cyber attacks and malicious activities enables social media companies to refine their cybersecurity measures, preserving platform integrity.

The project seeks to answer three key questions: Can data patterns unveil Twitter accounts engaged in cyber attacks or malicious activities? How does the behavior of Twitter spammers differ from legitimate users concerning account and tweet characteristics, and how can this enhance cybersecurity measures? Can we predict a Twitter account's spam likelihood based on its attributes, and which factors are most influential? The study employed diverse classification techniques like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Classification Trees, Random Forests, Bagging, and Boosting. The model with the best performance metrics (Accuracy and AUC) on a test set was selected and further fine-tuned and validated to confirm its accuracy.

Twitter's popularity has attracted malicious actors over the past decade. This research deploys a model that effectively classifies spammers by incorporating user and tweet features. Among the seven techniques tested, Random Forest stood out with an 88.25% accuracy rate. While not exhaustive, the findings offer valuable insights for Twitter to identify spam accounts and have broader implications for cybersecurity. This study underscores the importance of data mining techniques in combating malicious activity, encouraging social media and website platforms to consider their adoption.
